## Project Overview

SAUNG is a UI/UX design concept for a mobile application addressing Indonesia's growing waste management crisis through innovative gamification and reward systems. The design transforms waste disposal from a mundane task into an engaging activity where users can exchange waste for valuable vouchers while learning about environmental sustainability.

This design project was developed as part of a Human Computer Interaction course by a collaborative team of 4 designers, where I led the UI/UX design and user research aspects.

### The Environmental Challenge

Indonesia faces a severe waste management crisis that demands immediate attention:

- **Massive Waste Generation**: Indonesia produced 35.93 million tons of waste in 2022, a 22.04% increase from 2021
- **Poor Management**: Only 62.49% of waste is properly managed, leaving 13.47 million tons unmanaged
- **Environmental Impact**: Unmanaged waste causes soil and water pollution, flooding, and disease spread
- **Plastic Pollution**: 17.9% of waste is plastic, threatening marine ecosystems and human health through microplastics
- **Food Waste**: 40.5% of waste consists of food waste, representing resource inefficiency
- **SDG Compliance**: Current situation contradicts UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 for sustainable cities and communities

### Gamification-Based Solution

SAUNG addresses these challenges through an innovative approach that makes waste management engaging and rewarding:

#### Coin-Based Reward System
- Users earn coins for properly disposing of waste
- Coins can be exchanged for valuable vouchers and rewards
- Progressive reward system encourages continued participation
- Real-world value creation from waste management activities

#### Educational Integration
- Comprehensive waste classification information
- Environmental articles and sustainability tips
- Learning-by-doing approach through practical application
- Building awareness about environmental impact

#### Mission and Level System
- Structured missions guide user behavior
- Level progression provides sense of achievement
- Challenges keep users engaged long-term
- Community aspects encourage friendly competition

### User Research & Target Audience Analysis

Comprehensive user research identified three primary user segments:

#### Environmental Activists
- Highly motivated by environmental impact
- Seek platforms for meaningful environmental contribution
- Value long-term sustainability outcomes
- Prefer innovative and effective strategies
