# Competition Challenge

The Global Design Awards 2024 presented participants with a unique challenge: design a complete fintech mobile application in just 48 hours, with a special focus on accessibility for users with disabilities.

## My Approach

I decided to tackle this challenge by first researching the specific needs of users with visual, motor, and cognitive impairments in financial applications...

## Design Process

### Research Phase (6 hours)
- Studied accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
- Analyzed existing accessible fintech apps
- Created user personas with disabilities

### Ideation Phase (8 hours)
- Sketched initial concepts focusing on large touch targets
- Explored voice navigation integration
- Designed high contrast color schemes

### Design Phase (24 hours)
- Created comprehensive design system
- Built interactive prototypes
- Tested with accessibility tools

### Presentation Phase (10 hours)
- Prepared competition presentation
- Created demo videos showing accessibility features
- Documented design decisions

## Key Features

The final design included several innovative accessibility features:

- **Voice Navigation**: Complete app navigation using voice commands
- **High Contrast Mode**: Automatically adjusts for users with visual impairments  
- **Large Touch Targets**: All interactive elements meet WCAG AAA standards
- **Screen Reader Optimization**: Semantic markup for better screen reader support

## Competition Results

The design was well-received by the judges and earned first place among 500+ participants from around the world. The accessibility-first approach resonated strongly with the judging panel.

## Impact

Following the competition, the organizers announced that accessibility compliance would become a mandatory requirement for all future design challenges, citing this project as an example of how inclusive design can enhance rather than compromise aesthetic appeal.
