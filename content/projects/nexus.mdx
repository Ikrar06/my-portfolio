## Event Overview

NEXUS 2024 was a technology seminar organized by Coder FT-UH (Fakultas Teknik, Universitas Hasanuddin) that brought together students, educators, and industry professionals to explore the latest trends in technology. As a member of the Publication, Design, and Documentation team, I was responsible for creating the complete visual identity and documenting the event experience.

## Design Philosophy

The visual identity for NEXUS 2024 was built around the concept of "Connecting Tech Minds" - representing the convergence of innovation, education, and professional networking in the technology sector. The design system incorporated modern, clean aesthetics with tech-inspired elements that would resonate with the target audience of students and tech professionals.

### Visual Elements

- **Logo**: A contemporary design that embodies connectivity and technological advancement
- **Mascot**: A friendly, tech-savvy character that became the face of the event and enhanced participant engagement
- **Color Palette**: Modern tech-inspired colors that convey innovation and professionalism
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts that work well across digital and print applications
- **Design Language**: Consistent visual elements that create cohesion across all materials

## Key Design Deliverables

My contributions to NEXUS 2024 included creating various essential visual elements:

### Brand Identity
- **Logo Design**: Created the main NEXUS 2024 logo and variations for different applications
- **Mascot Development**: Designed a memorable character that became central to the event's identity
- **Brand Guidelines**: Established consistent visual standards for the entire event

### Merchandise Design
- **T-shirts**: Designed event-branded apparel that participants could wear as keepsakes
- **Tote Bags**: Created functional and attractive bags that served as both merchandise and promotional items

### Event Materials
- **Certificates**: Designed official certificates for participants and speakers
- **Plaques**: Created commemorative awards for distinguished participants and organizers
- **Presentation Slides**: Developed templates and designs for seminar presentations

### Documentation Design
- **Live Reports**: Created real-time visual reports during the event to capture key moments

## Documentation and Coverage

Throughout the 2-month project timeline, I was actively involved in documenting the entire process:

- **Pre-Event Phase**: Captured the design development process and team preparations
- **Event Day Coverage**: Created live visual reports and documented key seminar moments
- **Post-Event Summary**: Compiled comprehensive documentation of the event's success

## Technical Skills Applied

This project allowed me to utilize and develop various technical skills:

- **Adobe Photoshop**: For photo editing and visual compositions
- **Adobe Illustrator**: For logo design, mascot creation, and vector graphics
- **Figma**: For collaborative design work and digital prototyping
- **Canva**: For quick social media graphics and presentation materials
- **Print Design**: Understanding of production requirements for merchandise and materials

## Results and Impact

The visual identity and documentation work for NEXUS 2024 contributed to:

- **Enhanced Brand Recognition**: The cohesive design system helped establish NEXUS as a recognizable tech event
- **Participant Engagement**: The mascot and interactive visual elements increased attendee involvement
- **Professional Presentation**: High-quality materials elevated the seminar's professional image
- **Lasting Memories**: Merchandise and certificates provided tangible keepsakes for participants
- **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive visual documentation preserved the event's legacy

## Team Collaboration

Working within the Publication and Documentation team taught me valuable lessons about:

- **Collaborative Design**: Working effectively with team members on shared visual projects
- **Time Management**: Meeting tight deadlines while maintaining quality standards
- **Communication**: Clearly presenting design concepts and receiving feedback
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting designs based on team input and practical constraints

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced several important principles:

- **Consistency is Key**: Maintaining visual consistency across all materials strengthens brand recognition
- **User-Centered Design**: Considering the target audience in every design decision improves engagement
- **Documentation Importance**: Thorough documentation preserves the event's story and impact
- **Collaboration Value**: Working as part of a team produces better results than individual efforts
- **Technical Versatility**: Being proficient in multiple design tools increases creative possibilities

## Looking Forward

The success of NEXUS 2024's visual identity and documentation has set a strong foundation for future tech events at Universitas Hasanuddin. The design system and processes developed during this project continue to influence how Coder FT-UH approaches event branding and documentation, contributing to the organization's growing reputation in the tech education space.
